# Example 4

# This is from a lemma that came up during a Coq proof (that the size
# of commands is always reduced by the step relation in our MWU
# language https://github.com/gstew5/cage). Using Simp we were able to
# easily verify that it's true before attempting to prove it in Coq.

  d := 1 + 2*n*(c+1)
}

verify {
  intros n, c;
  assume 0 <= c && 0 < n;
  assert f1(n, c) < f2(n, c)
}
